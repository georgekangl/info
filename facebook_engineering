Article: Under the hood: Facebook Marketplace powered by artificial intelligence
Summary: Marketplace has two major players: Buyer and Seller.
AI can power and boost the experience of them. 
Buyer
- recommend according to typed text, previous search history, buying history, location, or other tags(tokens)
- recommend if your willing stuff is sold or gone. Search similarity according to your willing stuff.
- Simple interaction with AI assitant, M. Like if the thing is still available.

Seller: 
- Understand the text decription and uploaded photos to create more accurate categaries, keywords and index.
- Detect the mismatch of the object description and the object photos.

Article: 2018 @Scale Conference recap
Summary: trending in large scale systems.
- AI/ML: hardware, infra,
- Data: fast SQL, DB like CDN, 
- Tools: resource management, static analysis, large testing

=============
Article: Migrating Messenger storage to optimize performance
Summary: 
- old: old data schema, HBase, spinning disk
  new: new data schema, MyRocks, SSD
  Both: Iris queue

- Migration Flow: 
Normal: using mark of last data point and double writing(state machine)
also using monitoring tools, data and API validation, 
providing a revert plan
Buffered: the account without quite time, like company automatic bot
pick a cutoff time, create a snapshot of old data, new data queued to Iris, copy old data to MyRocks. then process queued data, and start double writing.

- Scale: 
Bistro Framework, parallelize the work.

- Benefits:
better data compression(MyRocks with Zstandard)
better disaster recovery
better read/write(Lighting with flash storage)
easy to add new feature

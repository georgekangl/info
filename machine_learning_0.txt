BACKGROUND
========================================
machine learning vs deep learning

ML - Algorithms that parse data, learn from that data, and then apply what theyâ€™ve learned to make informed decisions
DL - In practical terms, deep learning is just a subset of machine learning. 
with a deep learning model, the algorithms can determine on their own if a prediction is accurate or not.
deep learning uses a layered structure of algorithms called an artificial neural network (ANN).

Brief Intro
- ML: teach a computer to make prediction or inference.
- 	generate model data and 
	train a model and 
	generate inference in real time
- Machine learning is a continuous cycle.
??? what is ground truth?

Preparation
- IAM, S3 bucket
- sagemaker notebook instance, using Jupyter Notebook
- Jupyter Notebook: 
	The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

BACKGROUND
========================================
machine learning vs deep learning

ML - Algorithms that parse data, learn from that data, and then apply what theyâ€™ve learned to make informed decisions
DL - In practical terms, deep learning is just a subset of machine learning. 
with a deep learning model, the algorithms can determine on their own if a prediction is accurate or not.
deep learning uses a layered structure of algorithms called an artificial neural network (ANN).

Brief Intro
- ML: teach a computer to make prediction or inference.
- 	generate model data and 
	train a model and 
	generate inference in real time
- Machine learning is a continuous cycle.
??? what is ground truth?
